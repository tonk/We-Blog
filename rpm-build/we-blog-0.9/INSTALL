1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- A working installation of Perl is required, version 5.8.8 or higher.
- The HTML::AnyCloud module

2. INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE CODE

To install  We-Blog  from the source code,  download the latest source
package from the official homepage, and unpack it:

  $ tar xfz we-blog-x.x.tar.gz

A directory called  we-blog-x.x will  appear  in the current working
directory.  Switch to superuser, get into the newly created directory,  and
type "make install" at a shell prompt:

  we-blog-x.x]# make install

This will install executables, manual pages, documentation, and application
data to the /usr/local/ directory,  and place  the Bash completion  file to
/etc/bash_completion.d/. To use a different installation directory,  change
the value of "prefix" on the command line. For example, if you want to ins-
tall We-Blog to /usr/,  type the following command:

  we-blog-x.x]# make prefix=/usr install

Alternatively, you can choose to install executables only. For instance, to
install We-Blog into your home directory, type:

  we-blog-x.x]$ make prefix=$HOME install_bin

Finally,  if you prefer to install all available files, but you do not have
superuser privileges, change the value of "compdir" to a directory you have
access to. For example:

  we-blog-x.x]$ make prefix=$HOME compdir='$(prefix)/etc' install
