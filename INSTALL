user in order to run commands described in this section. To do so, type the

  $ su -

2.1. Installing on Debian

We-Blog is currently available in  both testing (Squeeze) and unstable
(Sid) version of Debian. To install it, open a terminal, and run the follo-
wing command:

  # apt-get install we-blog

2.2. Installing on Fedora

We-Blog is currently available in both Fedora 12 (Constantine)  and 13
(Goddard).  To install it,  open a terminal, and run the following command:

  # yum install we-blog

2.3. Installing on Ubuntu

We-Blog  is currently available in  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS  (Lucid Lynx). To
install it, open a terminal, and run the following command:

  # sudo apt-get install we-blog


3. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

Currently, there is no installer for Microsoft Windows. To use We-Blog
there,  download the latest version from the official homepage,  unpack it,
and use the batch  files that are  located in  we-blog-0.5/windows/.
For example:

  C:\we-blog-0.5\windows> we-blog init

Alternatively, you can use We-Blog with Cygwin. In that case, see Sec-
tion 4, "Installing from the Source Code" for detailed installation instru-
ctions.


4. INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE CODE

To install  We-Blog  from the source code,  download the latest source
package from the official homepage, and unpack it:

  $ tar xfz we-blog-0.5.tar.gz

A directory called  we-blog-0.5 will  appear  in the current working
directory.  Switch to superuser, get into the newly created directory,  and
type "make install" at a shell prompt:

  we-blog-0.5]# make install

This will install executables, manual pages, documentation, and application
data to the /usr/local/ directory,  and place  the Bash completion  file to
/etc/bash_completion.d/. To use a different installation directory,  change
the value of "prefix" on the command line. For example, if you want to ins-
tall We-Blog to /usr/,  type the following command:

  we-blog-0.5]# make prefix=/usr install

Alternatively, you can choose to install executables only. For instance, to
install We-Blog into your home directory, type:

  we-blog-0.5]$ make prefix=$HOME install_bin

Finally,  if you prefer to install all available files, but you do not have
superuser privileges, change the value of "compdir" to a directory you have
access to. For example:

  we-blog-0.5]$ make prefix=$HOME compdir='$(prefix)/etc' install
